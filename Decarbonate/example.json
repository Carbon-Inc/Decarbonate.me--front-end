  "description": "\nBehavioral questions are important, and can sometimes make the difference between getting hired and being passed on. In this talk we will cover usage of continuous development practices to iterate towards personal improvement, so that you can more easily think on your feet and convey a sense of confidence and competency in interviews and in the workplace. We will also cover some key business concepts as they relate to behavioral questions, and how to traverse common behavioral conundrums in corporate settings. \n\n\n\nAbout our Presenter:\n\nHugo Guerra works as a Front End Software Engineer at Swyfft, as part of their engineering team. Prior to that, he worked in the Seattle tech sector as a Project Manager and Systems/Process analyst for over a decade. In this time, he has interviewed candidates for various positions, most recently for front end and back end development. He is a graduate of the Code Fellows advanced JavaScript track, and also holds various industry-compliant certifications. \n",
